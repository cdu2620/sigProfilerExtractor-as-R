# sigProfilerExtractor-as-R

based on <a href="https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerExtractor/blob/master/sigproextractor/sigpro.py">this</a> code. I translated the calculate_similarities function into R. Given three text files (I have provided samples, but you can replace them with three of your own that follow the same format), I also convert them into usable files for the function. The result produces a chart displaying the total mutations, KL divergence, L1 and L2 norms/percentages, and cosine similarity.
